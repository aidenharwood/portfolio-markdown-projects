## Overview

ArgoCD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes that automatically synchronizes your cluster state with configurations stored in Git repositories. This implementation is used to manage applications running in the cluster on which this site is hosted.

## Features

- **Declarative GitOps**: Application definitions stored as code in Git
- **Automated Sync**: Continuous monitoring and deployment of changes
- **Web UI & CLI**: Comprehensive management interfaces

## Technical Details

ArgoCD follows the GitOps pattern where Git repositories serve as the single source of truth for application configurations. The ArgoCD controller continuously monitors these repositories and ensures the live cluster state matches the desired state defined in Git.
